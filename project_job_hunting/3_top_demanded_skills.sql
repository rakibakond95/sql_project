üîç Insights
1. SQL is still king üëë

Despite all the modern tools, SQL remains the most in-demand skill, reinforcing its foundational role in data engineering and analytics.

2. Python is nearly as critical üêç

Widely used for data pipelines, automation, ETL, and integration with frameworks (e.g., Spark, Pandas).

3. Cloud skills are essential ‚òÅÔ∏è

AWS and Azure together account for 15,567 job mentions, showing that cloud-native data pipelines are now standard.

4. Spark holds strong as the big data engine ‚ö°

Still a core technology for handling distributed data processing, especially in cloud or big data environments.

‚úÖ Summary

To stay competitive in data engineering:

Learn SQL + Python as your foundation, and master a cloud platform (AWS/Azure) + Spark for handling large-scale data systems.
